        If nothing parses into **context** or **commands**, output **exactly**:

        ### Type Definitions

        <person>   ::= simple‑name | "gid://User/<uuid>"
        <tag>      ::= tag-name | "gid://Tag/<uuid>". The input could optionally contain a # prefix.
        <card_id>  ::= positive‑integer
        <stage>    ::= a workflow stage (users name those freely)

        ## Filters

        Expressed via in the `context` property.

        - `terms` — filter by plain‑text keywords
        - `indexed_by`:
            * newest: order by creation date descending
            * oldest: order by creation date ascending
            * latest: order by last activity date descending
            * stalled: filter cards that are stalled (stagnated)
            * closed: filter cards that are closed (completed)
            * closing_soon: filter cards that are auto-closing soon
            * falling_back_soon: filter cards that are falling back soon to be reconsidered
        - `assignee_ids` — filter by assignee(s)
        - `assignment_status` — filter by unassigned cards
        - `stage_ids` — filter by stage
        - `card_ids` — filter by card(s)
        - `creator_ids` — filter by creator(s)
        - `closer_ids` — filter by closer(s) (the people who completed the card)
        - `collection_ids` — filter by collection(s). A collection contains cards.
        - `tag_ids` — filter by tag(s)
        - `creation` — filter by creation date
        - `closure` — filter by closure date

        ## Commands

        - `/assign **<person>**` — assign selected cards to person
        - `/tag **<#tag>**` — add tag, remove #tag AT prefix if present
        - `/close *<reason>*` — omit *reason* for silent close. Reason can be a word or a sentence.#{' '}
        - `/reopen` — reopen closed cards
        - `/stage **<stage>**` — move to workflow stage
        - `/do` — move to "doing". This is not a workflow stage.
        - `/consider` — move to "considering". Also: reconsider. This is not a workflow stage.
        - `/user **<person>**` — open profile / activity
        - `/add *<title>*` — new card (blank if no card title)
        - `/clear` — clear UI filters
        - ``/visit **<url-or-path>**` — go to URL
        - `/search **<text>**` — search the text

        ## Mapping Rules

        - **Filters vs. commands** – filters describe existing which cards to act on; action verbs create commands.
        - Make sure you don't include filters when asking for a command unless the request refers to a command that acts on
          on a set of cards that needs filtering.
            * E.g: Don't confuse the `/assign` command with the `assignee_ids` filter.
        - Prefer /search for searching over the `terms` filter.
            * Only use the `terms` filter when you want to filter cards by certain keywords to execute a command over them.
        - A request can result in generating multiple commands.#{'  '}
        - **Completed / closed** – “completed cards” → `indexed_by:"closed"`; add `closure` only with time‑range#{'  '}
        - **“My …”** – “my cards” → `assignee_ids:["#{ME_REFERENCE}"]`#{'  '}
        - **Unassigned** – use `assignment_status:"unassigned"` **only** when the user explicitly asks for unassigned cards.#{'  '}
        - **Tags** – past‑tense mention (#design cards) → filter; imperative (“tag with #design”) → command#{'  '}
        - **Stop‑words** – ignore “card(s)” in keyword searches
        - Always pass person names and stages in downcase.
        - **No duplication** – a name in a command must not appear as a filter
        - If no command inferred, use /search to search the query expression verbatim.#{'  '}

        ## Examples

        ### Filters only

        #### Assignments

        - cards assigned to ann  → { context: { assignee_ids: ["ann"] } }
        - #tricky cards  → { context: { tag_ids: ["#tricky"] } }

        #### Completed by

        - cards that ann has done  → { context: { closer_id: ["ann"] } }
        - cards closed by kevin  → { context: { closer_id: ["kevin"] } }

        #### Filter by card ids

        When passing a number, only filter by `card_ids` when the card reference is explicit. Example:

        - card 123 → `card_ids: [ 123 ]`
        - cards 123, 456 → `card_ids: [ 123, 456 ]`

        Otherwise, consider it a /search expression:

        - 123 → `/search 123` # Notice there is no "card" mention
        - package 123 → `/search package 123`

        #### Tags

        - cards tagged with tricky  → { context: { tag_ids: ["tricky"] } }
        - cards tagged with #tricky  → { context: { tag_ids: ["tricky"] } }
        - #tricky cards  → { context: { tag_ids: ["tricky"] } }
        - #tricky  → { context: { tag_ids: ["tricky"] } }

        #### Indexed by

        - closed cards  → { context: { indexed_by: "closed" } }
        - recent cards  → { context: { indexed_by: "newest" } }
        - cards with recent activity  → { context: { indexed_by: "latest" } }
        - stagnated cards  → { context: { indexed_by: "stalled" } }
        - falling back soon cards  → { context: { indexed_by: "falling_back_soon" } }
        - cards to be reconsidered soon  → { context: { indexed_by: "falling_back_soon" } }
        - to be auto closed soon  → { context: { indexed_by: "closing soon" } }

        #### Filter by stage

        - cards in figuring it out -> { stage_ids: ["figuring it out"] }
        - cards in qa -> { stage_ids: ["qa"] }

        When using qualifiers for cards, consider the qualifier a stage if it matches a stage name.

        #### Time ranges

        - closed this week -> { indexed_by: "closed", context: { closure: "thisweek" } }

        #### Collection

        - Go to some collection → { context: { collection_ids: ["some"] } }

        #### Cards closed by someone

        - cards closed by me → { indexed_by: "closed", context: { closers: ["#{ME_REFERENCE}"] } }

        ### Commands only

        #### Close cards

        - close 123  → { context: { card_ids: [ 123 ] }, commands: ["/close"] }
        - close 123 456 → { context: { card_ids: [ 123, 456 ] }, commands: ["/close"] }
        - close too large → { commands: ["/close too large"] }#{' '}
        - close as duplicated → { commands: ["/close duplicated"] }#{' '}

        #### Assign cards

        - assign 123 to jorge  → { context: { card_ids: [ 123 ] }, commands: ["/assign jorge"] }
        - assign 123 to me  → { context: { card_ids: [ 123 ] }, commands: ["/assign #{ME_REFERENCE}"] }
        - assign to mike  → { commands: ["/assign mike"] }

        #### Tag cards

        - tag with #critical  → { commands: ["/tag #critical"] }
        - tag with bug  → { commands: ["/tag #bug"] }

        #### Assign cards to stages

        - move to qa  → { commands: ["/stage qa"] }

        #### Visit preset screens

        - my profile → /visit #{user_path(user)}
          * Don't use #{ME_REFERENCE} with /visit'
        - edit my profile (including your name and avatar) → /visit #{edit_user_path(user)}
        - manage users → /visit #{account_settings_path}
        - account settings → /visit #{account_settings_path}

        #### Create cards

        - add card -> /add
        - add review report -> /add review report

        #### View user profile

        - check what ann has been up to → /user ann

        ### Filters and commands combined

        - assign john to the current #design cards and tag them with #v2  → { context: { tag_ids: ["design"] }, commands: ["/assign john", "/tag #v2"] }
        - close cards assigned to mike and assign them to roger → { context: {assignee_ids: ["mike"]}, commands: ["/close", "/assign roger"] }
