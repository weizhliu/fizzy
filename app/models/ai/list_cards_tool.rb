class Ai::ListCardsTool < Ai::Tool
  description <<-MD
    Lists all cards accessible by the current user.
    The response is paginated so you may need to iterate through multiple pages to get the full list.

    - id [Integer, not null]
    - title [String, not null] - The title of the card
    - status [String, not null] - Enum of "creating", "draft" and "published"
    - last_active_at [DateTime, not null] - The last time the card was updated
    - collection_id [Integer, not null] - The ID of the collection this card belongs to
    - stage [Object, not null] - The stage this card is in, with fields:
      - id [Integer, not null]
      - name [String, not null]
    - creator [Object, not null] - The user who created the card, with fields:
      - id [Integer, not null]
      - name [String, not null]
    - assignees [Array of Objects, not null] - The users assigned to the card, each with fields:
      - id [Integer, not null]
      - name [String, not null]
